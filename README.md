# FTP Deployment: GitHub Action

This GitHub action copies the files via FTP from your Git project to your server in a specific path.

## Security and SSL

By default, `ftp_ssl_allow` is set to `true` to ensure your connection is encrypted. However, `ssl_verify_certificate` is set to `false` by default. This means your data is encrypted during transfer, but the Action does not verify if the server's certificate is valid or matches the hostname. This prevents connection errors with self-signed certificates or direct IP connections but leaves you vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if someone spoofs your DNS.

If you require strict security, set `ssl_verify_certificate: true` and ensure your server has a valid certificate matching the hostname used.

## Usage Example

Add this code in `./.github/workflows/your_action.yml`.

More about GitHub "secrets" in this article:
[Creating and storing encrypted secrets][1].

```yaml
name: CI -> Deploy to My website
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, development ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Here is the deployment action
      - name: Upload from public_html via FTP
        uses: airvzxf/ftp-deployment-action@latest
        with:
          server: ${{ secrets.FTP_SERVER }}
          user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
          local_dir: "./public_html"
```

Optionally, you can get the live version which has the last commits using the `master` branch like this:
`uses: airvzxf/ftp-deployment-action@master`.

## Settings

Usually the zero values mean unlimited or infinite. This table is based on the default values on `lftp-4.9.2`.

## NOTES

Main features:

- Copy all the files inside the specific folder from your GitHub repository to the specific folder in your server.
- Option to delete all the files in the specific remote folder before the upload.
- Using Alpine container means small size and faster creation of the container.
- Show messages in the console logs for every executed command.

TODOs:

- Add options for exclude delete files.
- Take all the logs from the Linux container then attach all into the Workflow Artifacts, to review unknown errors.
